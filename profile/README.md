## Glossia

Glossia is a modern and open-source localization toolchain.
Many solutions build on old-fashioned building blocks and principles,
and that led to a mastodon level of unbearable complexity and indirection.

We believe LLM capabilities laid the ground for a simpler solution,
but it requires reimagining localization as we know it today.
We are doing that at Glossia,
drawing ideas from open source and continuous software delivery,
and building and working with a thriving community that's eager to bring some fresh air to the ecosystem.
